# CSE_6250 Big Data Health Reproducibility Challenge - Team A3
The paper we are reproducing is "Farsight: Long-term diseases prediction using unstructured clinical nursing notes".

All code in this repo was developed by us. To the best of our knowledge the paper we are reproducing has no publically available code repo.
All code is written in python.

### Required Libraries
- jupyter
- pandas
- numpy 
- re
- nltk
- gensim
- tensorflow
- sklearn

### Data
The data used is in this project is available at https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/
The csv files used from the dataset are:
- ADMISSIONS.csv
- DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv
- NOTEEVENTS.csv
- PATIENTS.csv

### Functionality and running the code
All code we have developed so far is availble in the file CSE6250_Project_Code2.ipynb. To run the code open the notebook and press "Run all". Each cell's function is described within the notebook.
